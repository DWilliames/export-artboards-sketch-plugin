Export all selected artboards ‚Äî even when there are artboards overlapping each other, with a single action.

This mimics the behaviour that occurred before Sketch 44. It does this by creating a temporarily slice around each artboard, and copies the same export options from the artboard being sliced.

> **Export overlapping artboards once again!!**


## Usage

1. Add any export options you want to your artboards (e.g. Size, Prefix/Suffix or Format)
2. Select all the artboards you wish to export
3. <kbd>‚åò command</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> to (e)xport. Or select 'Plugins > Export Artboards'

**Note: The exported artboards will be named the same as their artboard layer name**


## Installation

1. Download the plugin
2. Double-click the file, 'ExportArtboards.sketchplugin'
3. That's it...
